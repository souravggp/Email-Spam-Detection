# Email Spam Classifier

This project is a machine learning application designed to classify emails as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam). It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess the text and train a classification model.

## Features
- **Preprocessing**: Cleans the email text by removing unnecessary characters, stopwords, and transforming text to lowercase.
- **Feature Extraction**: Uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert email text into numerical features.
- **Classification**: Employs machine learning models to classify emails, with Logistic Regression as the primary classifier.
- **Evaluation**: Measures model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.


   ```

## Usage

1. Load the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Email_Spam_Classifier.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and test its performance.
3. Use the model to classify new emails by inputting test strings.

## Workflow

1. **Data Loading**:
   - Load the email dataset containing labeled examples of spam and ham emails.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Convert text to lowercase.
   - Remove stopwords and punctuation.
   - Apply tokenization and stemming (optional).

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Use the `TfidfVectorizer` to transform text data into numerical features.

4. **Model Training**:
   - Train a Logistic Regression model on the preprocessed data.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - Test the model on a separate dataset and calculate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

6. **Testing**:
   - Test the model with new email strings to predict whether they are spam or ham.

## Example

```python
# Example email string for testing
email = ["Congratulations! You've won a $1,000 gift card. Click here to claim now!"]

# Predict using the trained model
prediction = model.predict(vectorizer.transform(email))
print("Spam" if prediction[0] == 1 else "Ham")
```

## Improvements
- Experiment with advanced models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or deep learning.
- Use word embeddings like Word2Vec, GloVe, or BERT for richer text representations.
- Tune hyperparameters for better model performance.
- Build a user-friendly web application for live email classification.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, matplotlib, nltk
